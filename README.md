# mc-comparison
A comparison of programming languages and styles for simulating a simple 
particle cluster.


## Introduction

The idea behind this project is similar to the [primes](https://github.com/PlummersSoftwareLLC/Primes)
project but with a focus on styles rather than just pure performance.

The task involves: (1) Reading particle positions and velocities, (2) For each
particle make a trial move, evaluate the Lennard-Jones energy and accept it
if 


## Install
